# Hindi-Digit-Recognition
Learning how to different accuracy for different classification methods are.

I wanted to learn about image digit recognition. Since MNIST was highly used data set I decided used the devnagri(hindi) digits.

Using just one classification method wouldn't have made me learn a lot so I decided to include 4-5 and also did ANN and CNN.

Moreover I also tried tuning the parameters to increase the accuracy.
